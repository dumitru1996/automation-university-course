Description:

Explore how to use RestAssured library to test REST API's.
REST API testing is a technique to test RESTful APIs and validate their correctness.
We send the request (preferably using automation) and record the response for further assertions.
This way we can check if the REST API is working fine or not.
REST API testing is mainly done using REST methods like, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.(and more).
